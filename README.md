### 1. Buck Converter (Step-Down)

Converts higher DC input voltage to a lower DC output voltage.

**Key Formula:**

```text
Vout = D × Vin


---

2. Boost Converter (Step-Up)

Steps up a lower input voltage to a higher output voltage.

Key Formula:

Vout = Vin / (1 − D)


---

3. Buck–Boost Converter

Provides output voltage that can be higher or lower than the input.

Key Formula:

Vout = −(D / (1 − D)) × Vin
